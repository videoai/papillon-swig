# Papillon SWIG Wrappers

The [Papillon SDK](https://videoai.net/papillon) is a software development kit that allows easy integration 
of [Digital Barriers](https://www.digitialbarriers.com) world-class video and image processing software within applications. 
This includes Face Recognition, Face Detection, Intelligent Motion Detection, Alarm Verification and Camera Tampering detection.

The [Papillon SDK](https://videoai.net/papillon) SDK is written in C++ and assembler when required to be lightning fast.
It also will leverage the power of GPU's and multi-core CPUs when available.

However, these days many applications are written in higher level languages, such as Java, C# and Python.
In this repository are the tools and code that are required to generate bindings for other languages.
For this, we make extensive use of a great open-source application called [SWIG](http://www.swig.org).

## Prerequisite

The following developer tools must be installed:
- **Cmake 3.X**, an open-source, cross-platform, build tool (https://cmake.org/download/)
- **Swig 3.0.X** (http://www.swig.org)
- For Java: **Java Developer Kit 8** (JDK) (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- For C#: **Visual Studio 2013, 2015 or 2017 with C# environment**
- **Papillon SDK 4.X or higher** (https://cmake.org/download/), installed and working. Make sure you have the environment PAPILLON_INSTALL_DIR set-up properly. 

## Quick Start

### Choose the bindings to generate
Edit the `/home/xxx/_install/CMakeLists.txt` and at the end of the file, comment out the languages you do not wish to generate bindings for. 

### Windows environment:
- Open a command prompt (console)
- Go to your 'papillon-swig' folder
- Create and go to build directory: mkdir build & cd build
- Generate Visual Studio solution for your environment using cmake command line, see example below.
You will have to set path toward swig tool (replace PATH_SWIG by the appropriate path).
For example, for Visual Studio 2013 (64-bit):

```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE="PATH_SWIG\swig.exe" -DSWIG_DIR="PATH_SWIG\swigwin-3.0.12"
```

- Then, open Visual Studio solution file and compile the C# or Java library for your environment

### Linux environment:
Make sure the following environment variables are set in your _.bashrc_ file

```
export PAPILLON_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Papillon
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Papillon/lib
```

To compile the wrappers...

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DVERBOSE=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/xxx/_install
make
make install
```
It is possible to configure you own java package for java bindings. For example, add `-DJAVA_PACKAGE=net.videoai.papillon` to the cmake command. 

You will also need to update your runtime library path.

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Papillon/lib:/home/xxx/_install/lib
```

## How to use wrappers?

### Python

To use the Python wrappers you need to update your _PYTHONPATH_.

```  
export PYTHONPATH=/home/xxx/_install/lib
```

You then can run the examples.

```
cd /home/xxx/_install/examples/python
python PapillonCoreExample.py
python PapillonFaceDetect.py
```

### Java

When you run SWIG and JAVA a set of Java files are generated for each Papillon class. The default package is `net.videoai.papillon.core`. With your favourite Java compiler you need to turn these into class files. For example,

```
export CLASSPATH=/home/xxx/_install/lib/java/PapillonCoreJava
cd /home/xxx/_install/lib/java/PapillonCoreJava
javac -d . $(find . -name "*.java")
```

Next, if you want to run one of the examples you need to make sure the java interpreter can pick up these class files. 
Be sure you add the right import at the top of the example if you have specify a JAVA_PACKAGE to generate the bindings. 

```
cd /home/xxx/_install/examples/java
javac ExampleCoreImage.java
java -cp /home/xxx/_install/lib/java/PapillonCoreJava:. -Djava.library.path=/home/xxx/_install/lib ExampleCoreImage

```

### C#
When you run SWIG and CSharp a set of CSharp files are generated for each Papillon class.
When you compile one of the examples you need to include these files.
Alternatively, you can build a CSharp library from these files and include that in your project.

For example

```
cd /home/xxx/_install/examples/csharp/
mcs -unsafe -out:ExampleCoreImage.exe ../../lib/csharp/src/*.cs ExampleCoreImage.cs
./ExampleCoreImage.exe
```


### Ruby

This is still experimental and you will need to turn this on in the main _CMakeList.txt_ file.

```  
export RUBYLIB=/home/xxx/_install/lib
```
